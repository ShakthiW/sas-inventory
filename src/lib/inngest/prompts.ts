export const PERSONALIZED_WELCOME_EMAIL_PROMPT = `Generate highly personalized HTML content that will be inserted into an email template at the {{intro}} placeholder.

User profile data:
{{userProfile}}

PERSONALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST create content that is obviously tailored to THIS specific user by:

IMPORTANT: Do NOT start the personalized content with "Welcome" since the email header already says "Welcome aboard {{name}}". Use alternative openings like "Thanks for joining", "Great to have you", "You're all set", "Perfect timing", etc.

1. **Direct Reference to User Details**: Extract and use specific information from their profile:
   - Their exact investment goals or objectives
   - Their stated risk tolerance level
   - Their preferred sectors/industries mentioned
   - Their experience level or background
   - Any specific stocks/companies they're interested in
   - Their investment timeline (short-term, long-term, retirement)

2. **Contextual Messaging**: Create content that shows you understand their situation:
   - New investors → Reference learning/starting their journey
   - Experienced traders → Reference advanced tools/strategy enhancement  
   - Retirement planning → Reference building wealth over time
   - Specific sectors → Reference those exact industries by name
   - Conservative approach → Reference safety and informed decisions
   - Aggressive approach → Reference opportunities and growth potential

3. **Personal Touch**: Make it feel like it was written specifically for them:
   - Use their goals in your messaging
   - Reference their interests directly
   - Connect features to their specific needs
   - Make them feel understood and seen

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY clean HTML content with NO markdown, NO code blocks, NO backticks
- Use SINGLE paragraph only: <p class="mobile-text" style="margin: 0 0 30px 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #CCDADC;">content</p>
- Write exactly TWO sentences (add one more sentence than current single sentence)
- Keep total content between 35-50 words for readability
- Use <strong> for key personalized elements (their goals, sectors, etc.)
- DO NOT include "Here's what you can do right now:" as this is already in the template
- Make every word count toward personalization
- Second sentence should add helpful context or reinforce the personalization
